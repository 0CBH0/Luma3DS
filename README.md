# Luma3DS
*Noob-proof (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

**Compiling:**

First you need to clone the repository recursively with: 'git clone --recursive https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS.git'  
To compile, you'll need armips, [bin2c](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bin2c/), and a recent build of [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) added to your PATH. [HERE](http://www91.zippyshare.com/v/ePGpjk9r/file.html) is a pre-compiled version of armips for Windows.  
Finally just run 'make' and everything should work!  
You can find the compiled files in the 'out' folder.
