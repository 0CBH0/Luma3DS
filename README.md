# AuReiNand
*A modification of the ReiNand custom firmware*

**Compiling:**

You'll need armips, [bin2c](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bin2c/), and a recent build of [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) added to your PATH. [HERE](http://www91.zippyshare.com/v/ePGpjk9r/file.html) is a pre-compiled version of armips for Windows.  
Then, just run "make" and everything should work!  
You can find the compiled files in the 'out' folder.
