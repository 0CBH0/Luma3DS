# Luma3DS
*Noob-proof (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

**Compiling:**

First you need to clone the repository recursively with: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS.git`
To compile, you'll need [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips), [bin2c](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bin2c/), and a recent build of [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) added to your PATH.  
For your convenience, here are [Windows](http://www91.zippyshare.com/v/ePGpjk9r/file.html) and [Linux](https://mega.nz/#!uQ1T1IAD!Q91O0e12LXKiaXh_YjXD3D5m8_W3FuMI-hEa6KVMRDQ) builds of armips (thanks to who compiled them!).  
Finally just run `make` and everything should work!  
You can find the compiled files in the 'out' folder.
